# Simulate_QM_spectra

A simple and versatil tool for simulate absorption spectra from QM data.

It supports parsing of TD-DFT data from Gaussian, OpenMolcas/Molcas, Orca, TeraCHEM and DALTON outputs.

Additionally supports two photon absorption data from DALTON.

Created by Ra√∫l Losantos and initially by Alejandro Jodra.
